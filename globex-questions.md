# Globex Data Task

Globex is an export company that supplies widgets to consumers around the world. Their **DBA** (database administrator) recently left without warning and they need some help. There are a series of questions below that need answering.

If you're unfamiliar with SQL the questions loosely follow the structure of the Module 9 additional reading.

(We have provided the answers to all of the questions below. This will let you check your working as you go.)

Note: You should have already followed the [set-up instructions](https://github.com/CorndelWithSoftwire/Globex-Database). If not, do that now.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>153</details>

8. How many employees at PayBand 3 or below are **not** Union members?
<details><summary>Answer</summary>60</details>

`select count(1) from Employee where PayBand<=3 and UnionMembershipNo is null`

## Joins

For these questions, note that "orders" tracks Globex buying stock in, whilst "sales" track the sale of the same products to clients.

1.  What is the name of the product that was requested in the order with ID 149?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>Flector</details>

`select p.Name
from product p
join [order] o on o.Product = p.Id
where o.Id=149`

2.  How many units of the product from the previous question were sold on the credit card with number `3535880159004410`?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>7098.00</details>
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>Doesn't look like the card number is on the sale; can you find it elsewhere? Does this placement make sense?</details>

`select sum(amount)
from product p
join sale s on s.ProductId = p.Id
join [user] u on s.username = u.username
where p.Name = 'flector'
and u.CardNumber='3535880159004410'`

3.  We've noticed an error in an upstream system. When updating an employee's manager the employees table hasn't been correctly updated. The `ManagerId` has been updated, but the `ManagerFirstName` and `ManagerSurname` have not. How many records does this impact?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>4</details>

## Aggregation

The value of an order can be calculated by multiplying the `Amount` of product ordered by its `SellingPrice`.

> You may want to make use of aggregate functions like `MAX` and `SUM` in the below.

1.  What was the value of order 115?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>470866.56</details>

    `select sum(p.sellingprice * o.Amount)

where o.Id=115`

2.  What is the value of the highest value order in the system?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>960151.08</details>

`select sum(p.sellingprice * o.Amount) as v, o.Id
from product p
join [order] o on o.Product = p.Id
group by o.Id
order by v desc`


3.  What was the value of the most expensive order placed in 2019?

    <details><summary>Hint</summary>

    You may find it helpful to use a [temporary table](https://codingsight.com/introduction-to-temporary-tables-in-sql-server/) or [local variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/declare-local-variable-transact-sql?).
