# Globex Data Task

Globex is an export company that supplies widgets to consumers around the world. Their **DBA** (database administrator) recently left without warning and they need some help. There are a series of questions below that need answering.

If you're unfamiliar with SQL the questions loosely follow the structure of the Module 9 additional reading.

(We have provided the answers to all of the questions below. This will let you check your working as you go.)

Note: You should have already followed the [set-up instructions](https://github.com/CorndelWithSoftwire/Globex-Database). If not, do that now.

## Joins

For these questions, note that "orders" track the purchases of products that Globex has made, whilst "sales" track the sale of the same products.

1.  What is the name of the product that was requested in the order with ID 149?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>Flector</details>

    <details><summary>Answer</summary>7098.00</details>
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>Doesn't look like the card number is on the sale; can you find it elsewhere? Does this placement make sense?</details>

3.  We've noticed an error in an upstream system. When updating an employee's manager the employees table hasn't been correctly updated. The `ManagerId` has been updated, but the `ManagerFirstName` and `ManagerSurname` have not. How many records does this impact?
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>4</details>

## Aggregation

The value of an order can be calculated by multiplying the `Amount` of product ordered by its `SellingPrice`.
