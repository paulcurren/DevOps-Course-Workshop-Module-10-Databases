# Globex Database Exercise

## Pre-requisites

You will need to have the following tools installed:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* A tool to let you interact with an MS SQL database.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

There are extensions for Visual Studio Code that let you connect to SQL database. You will need to install [SQL Server (mssql)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql).

## First time setup

Ensure that docker is running on your machine by using `docker ps`.
From command line, in this directory run the startup script appropriate for your shell. (Either `startup.bat` or `startup.sh`; Powershell & `startup.bat` recommended on Windows as Git Bash will not run some of the commands).

## Connect to the database

Check that the container is running with `docker ps`, you should see something like the following:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                    NAMES
<SOME_ID>      module-10   "powershell -Command…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp   module-10-container
```

If it isn't, run `docker start module-10-container` to start it. If you stop the container for any reason (e.g. restarting your machine) you'll need to run this command.

Connect to the database with the following details:  
Server name: `localhost`  
Port Number: 1433  
_Note, in SSMS or the SQL Server extension for VSCode, provide the server name and port together using this syntax: `localhost,1433`_  
Database name: `globex`  
Authentication: `SQL Server Authentication`  
Login: `sa`  
Password: `Password123!`
